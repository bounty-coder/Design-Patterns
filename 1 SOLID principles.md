What are SOLID principle??
It defines rules/principles to provide a set of guidelines to writing the object oriented code.

**Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)** - Each class should have a single responsibilty
**Open-Closed Principle(OCP)** - Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
**Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP)** - Objects of a derived class should be substitutable for objects of base class.
**Interface Segregation Principle(ISP)** - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
**Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)** - High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depends on abstraction.
